This project's goal is to organize some data.  The data will be downloaded by the program if it is not in the current working directory.  The output of the program is given here, so there will be problems with overwrting if these output files are not renamed or moved.  The output is 2 hdf5 files.  They contain tables of measurements of sensor data, like from accelerometers.  The big table contains many measurements of each variable and also identifies the person who is holding the sensor (the subject) and what activity they are doing.  The small table contains averages of these values tabulated over subject and activity.
